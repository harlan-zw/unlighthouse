Using the Unlighthouse Vite plugin allows you to close the feedback loop in fixing your Google Lighthouse issues in your
development site.

## Install

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @unlighthouse/vite
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @unlighthouse/vite
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @unlighthouse/vite
```

### Git ignore reports

Unlighthouse will save your reports in `outputDir` (`.unlighthouse` by default),
it's recommended you .gitignore these files.

```
.unlighthouse
```

## Usage

To begin using Unlighthouse, you'll need to add the plugin to `plugins`.

When you run your Vite app, it will give you the URL of client, only once you visit the client will Unlighthouse start.


```ts vite.config.ts
import Unlighthouse from '@unlighthouse/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    Unlighthouse({
      // config
    })
  ]
})
```

### Providing Route Definitions

If you're using the [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) plugin, you can provide route definitions to Unlighthouse.

You will need to hook into the plugin using the following code.

```ts vite.config.ts
import { useUnlighthouse } from 'unlighthouse'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    Pages({
      // ...
      onRoutesGenerated(routes) {
        // tell Unlighthouse about the routes
        const unlighthouse = useUnlighthouse()
        if (unlighthouse?.hooks)
          hooks.callHook('route-definitions-provided', routes)
      }
    }),
  ]
})
```


## Configuration

You can either configure Unlighthouse via the plugin, or you can provide a  [config file](/guide/guides/config) file
in the root directory.

### Example

```js vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    Unlighthouse({
      scanner: {
        // simulate a desktop device
        device: 'desktop',
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

# Unlighthouse CLI

Using the CLI is the quickest way to get familiar with Unlighthouse and is recommended for new users.

## Setup

_Requirements: Node 14.x or higher, Node 16.x recommended._

Using npx:

```bash
npx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
# OR pnpm dlx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

By default Unlighthouse will attempt to use your system Chrome / Chromium install.
If these are missing, a Chromium binary will be installed on your system.

# Unlighthouse CLI

Using the CLI is the quickest way to get familiar with Unlighthouse and is recommended for new users.

## Setup

Using npx

```bash
npx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
# OR pnpm dlx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

If you don't have an accessible chrome installation, you can use the `unlighthouse-puppeteer` binary.

```bash
npx unlighthouse-puppeteer --site example.com
```

## Setup

_Requirements: Node 18.x or higher._

Using npx:

```shell
npx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
# OR pnpm dlx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

By default, Unlighthouse will attempt to use your system Chrome / Chromium install.
If these are missing, a Chromium binary will be installed on your system.

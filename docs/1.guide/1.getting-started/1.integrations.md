# Integrations

Choose how to integrate Unlighthouse into your workflow: manual CLI scans for development, automated CI/CD checks for deployment pipelines, or build tool integration for framework-specific setups.

## Command Line

| Provider                 | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| [CLI](/integrations/cli) | Scan a production site such as [unlighthouse.dev](/).<br><br> You can manually provide a project mapping for [routes definitions](/guide/guides/route-definitions).                                                          |
| [CI](/integrations/ci)   | Run scans on sites based on automation events, i.e releasing and make [assertions on scores](/integrations/ci#assertions).<br><br> Can also be used to generate report sites such as [inspect.unlighthouse.dev](https://inspect.unlighthouse.dev/). |
